## Description
This application creates a random password based on some user input.
 The user is asked to choose a password length between 8 and 128 characters, 
 then select from 4 sets of characters to be used in generating the password.
 The base html and css files were provided by UCB Bootcamp -- my task was asked to
 edit the javascript so the application functions correctly.  
<br>
## Tools Used
An html and CSS page structure were provided by UCB Bootcamp. I used javascript to code the
 page alerts and the password generator function.
